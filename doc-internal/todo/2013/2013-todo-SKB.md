#### Weekly Summary
I worked on two issues this week.  The first problem was that I hit a road block trying to
run the new git-based build on the Win2008 server based VM.  I was hitting permission problems
and getting errors when launching the EXEs from the build scripts.  I worked with Harry Chandra
in IT to get a new WinServer 2003 based VM up that should be closer to our existing build server.  
  
The second item I worked on was some problems found by Martin at Agilent.  These are captured in 
issues 120, 118 and 117 in the github/xtuml/agilegc issue tracker.

#### Checklist
- Acquire Win2003-based build server vm  
- Agilegc #120: Try to reproduce
- Agilegc #118: Fix Agilent problem with OAL preferences not working when launched via CLI on Linux  
- Agilegc #117: Fix Agilent problem with build configurations not being found

#### Weekly Summary
As part of the ongoing promotion work of the compare/merge branch we decided to 
finally flip the switch in BridgePoint to go completely to models with generic 
packages and global data types.  This, of course, has had additional fallout for 
the unit tests.  The current working branch is Review-942847-05.  I updated the
model import dialog to remove the "Convert to generic packages" checkbox because
the operation is now perform as part of the built-in model upgrade that happens 
when any model is loaded.  

Also updated the default memory settings in BridgePoint to increase our initial
memory allocation and up the maximum we are allowed to consume as well.

#### Checklist
- promotion work with Travis
- fix linux splash
- update default mem settings

#### Weekly Summary
The promotion of the compare/merge work has had downstream effects on the 
unit tests and test models.  This is causing additional work during the
promotion.  

I recently updated the JRE included inside BridgePoint.  Cort reported that
BridgePoint no longer launched properly.  On the build server I had takend the
jre*.bin file and extracted it with 7-zip.  This was insufficient to properly
unpack the data.  So, I got on a linux VM and executed the .bin file.  This 
installed and extracted the data to a subdirectory.  Then I zipped the created
folder and put it on the build server where I unzipped it into the installation 
data directory.  After this process, executing BP on linux worked.

#### Checklist
- Continued testing and development with Travis on the compare/merge branch
- Help Heba get set up to debug problem reported by Agilent
- debug & fix JRE problem on linux

Finally, I worked with Cort to get up to speed on where he's currently at with the

design note to synch up and look for areas where I can help.

    Summary Report for Week of 2013/01/01-27

#### Summary
The beginning of the year was focused on our push to get the xtUML Editor release
done.  

Work was done for the move to eclipse 3.7 -   
The initial pass of development work to update API changes and to support the 
build infrastructure is done (by Travis).  I made one pass through the JUnits. 
Things were "mostly OK".  There were some failures that must be investigated. 
Then we promoted the copyright update and the compare/merge work.  I created a 
new branch (Review-931194) based off of that and merged in the previous work. 
It is ready to restart JUnit testing.  I have not done a build server build on 
the new branch.

I also picked up the work for the xtUML Editor as Bob headed to Europe.

#### Checklist
xtUML Editor Installer -  
x "BridgePoint" graphic on install type choice page ... goes away with no product selection I think  
x Space in default path name "C:\MentorGraphics\xtUML Editor"  
x Release notes are BP release notes  
x Desktop shortcut still named "BridgePoint"  
x remove extra MC plugins like in demo  
x Splash screen is still BP splash  
x Remove option to "install into existing eclipse"  
x Installer says launcher is "xtUML Editor_Launcher.bat" but it is still "BridgePoint_Launcher.bat"  
x version of plugins is 3.6.3 (should be bumped to 3.6.4?)  
x Do get a "Failed to get prebuilder license" when Build Project is invoked  
x Do get a "Failed to get verifier license" when debug launch is invoked  
x smoke test
