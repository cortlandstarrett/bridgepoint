# Incorrect Verifier behavior when starting multiple instances of identical configuration
### xtUML Project Design Note


1. Abstract
-----------
Currently when multiple instances are started from an identical configuration
the instances are not all being executed properly.   This issue is raised to
investigate and resolve this problem.

2. History
----------

3. Document References

4. Background
-------------
When Verifier is started with multiple instances of an identical configuration, 
calls towards realized components are routed to the wrong instance 
(java object) when they are invoked from a delegated port of an intermediate 
nested component. 

In such situations all invocations on the VIEC interface will be invoked on 
same instance of the realized component (same java object) regardless of the 
fact that several configuration instances are started. 

Verifier must assure that calls made in one configuration instance are 
correctly propagated to the instance of the realized component which belongs to 
that configuration instance and not to the other one.

5. Requirements
---------------
5.1 When multiple instances of the same configuration are executed in verifier,
    each of these instances shall be treated as independent execution units.

9. Work Required
----------------

10. Unit Test
------------
10.1 Verify that calls from multiple instances of the same configuration are 
     routed correctly.
_- Import the Bugs_testbed.zip as an existing project 
   (from \\wv\dfs\bridgepoint\field_data\dts0100949572)
_- Fix the Java build path to correspond to the core.jar plugin in your install
_- Launch the "withoutDelegationToNested" debug launch configuration in Verifier
_- In Session Explorer execute all 3 instances of 
   withoutDelegationToNested::Bugs_testbed::library::CompA::portOne::ifOne::start 
   in sequence
_- Correct output in Console is shown:
   Simulation started.
   User invoked interface message: start
   CompRealized::init called on instance(1) with parameter instId = 1
   User invoked interface message: start
   CompRealized::init called on instance(2) with parameter instId = 2
   User invoked interface message: start
   CompRealized::init called on instance(3) with parameter instId = 3
_- Terminate the Verifier session

_- Launch the "withDelegationToNested" debug launch configuration in Verifier
_- In Session Explorer execute all 3 instances of 
   withDelegationToNested::Bugs_testbed::library::CompA::portOne::ifOne::start in sequence
   
_R CORRECT output in Console is shown:
   
   Simulation started.
   User invoked interface message: start
   CompRealized::init called on instance(1) with parameter instId = 1
   User invoked interface message: start
   CompRealized::init called on instance(2) with parameter instId = 2
   User invoked interface message: start
   CompRealized::init called on instance(3) with parameter instId = 3
   
_R Different instance of realized component is used in each component 
   configuration.
