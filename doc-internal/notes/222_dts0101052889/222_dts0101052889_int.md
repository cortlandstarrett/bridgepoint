# ToolTip multiple windows feature is broken
### xtUML Project Implementation Note


1. Abstract
-----------
  During BP4.1.10 release, a fix for IllegalArgumentException was introduced in 
dts0101051962. This fix broke tooltip multiple windows feature.  
This note describe how to fix this.  

2. Document References
----------------------

3. Background
-------------
   During BP release, issue [3] were found in the testing phase, and fixed.
  Unfortunately, the fix resolve the problem but broke the multiple tooltip 
  windows feature.

   Issue [3] reports an internal IllegalArgumentException when mouse hover on 
  text based elements  associated with Associations, Transitions, Informal 
  messages, etc.

4. Requirements
---------------
4.1 Tooltip feature shall not cause any execution exceptions.  

4.2 User Shall be able to open more than one tooltip window as the same time.  

5. Work Required
----------------
5.1 Eclipse design for ToolTip Helper (the object responsibles to manipulate the
  tooltip figure) assumes that there be a single helper for each graphical 
  editor. Each time the graphical element has tooltip figure, Eclipse invokes 
  the helper object with graphical element source and the tooltip figure 
  objects.

   In BridgePoint ToolTip Helper design, the helper is associated with its 
 graphical source element. i.e. for a single graphical editor, there are a number 
 of tooltip helpers objects (created when needed) equals to the number of canvas 
 elements with tooltip figure associated. When mouse hovers a canvas element, 
 the associated helper will be created (if not exist yet) and invoked.
 
  This design allows to support multiple tooltip windows, as the helper can 
 maintain only single tooltip window visible at a time, and listening to its 
 actions such as close and update.
 
  In addition to these helper, there is a default tooltip helper that is used 
 when mouse hovers any empty canvas area, or any canvas element without detailed
 tooltip window which are Ports, ISM and CSM icons, as these elements do not 
 have a detailed tooltip window, a single helper -default helper- is only used.
 
 
 Currently the elements support detailed tooltip window:
 - DecoratedPolylineConnection represents line shaped elements such as 
 connectors and associations.  
 - ShapeImageFigure:  represents box shaped elements such as components and 
 model classes.
 
5.2 The fix done in [3] replaced getCursorTarget() with getMouseTarget() in  
  GraphicalEditor.createGraphicalViewer(...).new ScrollingGraphicalViewer() {...}.
  setEditDomain(...).new DomainEventDispatcher() {...}.getToolTipHelper()

   The justification for that change was that getCursorTarget() returns the 
  exact object under the mouse cursor, which will be in this case : TextFlow
  object. On the other hand, getMouseTarget returns the semantic/logic 
  object under the mouse cursor which will be in the case of floating text a 
  DecoratedPolylineConnection object.
  i.e. getMouseTarget() runs a logic to determine the suitable object to 
  return.  
	
	
   This change caused to use the default helper for all canvas elements as 
  getMouseTarget() returns null, as BridgePoint implementation for 
  findMouseEventTargetAt() method that return the logical element under mouse
  in extended TextFlow class and DecoratedPolylineConnection is not exist.
	
	
   Since a single helper is used for all elements, the multiple windows feature
  got broken.
	
   In order to resolve this, the changes in [3] shall roll back, which means
  providing another fix to the issue.
	

5.3 The lines shaped elements with a floating text associated with-e.g. 
  Associations- are represented with two different classes, a 
  DecoratedPolylineConnection object for the line, and a TextFlow object for 
  the floating text.  
	
   When mouse hovers on the floating text, getCursorTarget() returns a TextFlow
  object, and since it is not support, the default helper is used instead of 
  the helper associated with DecoratedPolylineConnection instance.
	
	
   To prevent this, when getCursorTarget() returns TextFlow, we need to query
  for DecoratedPolylineConnection related for the same element in order
  to user the right helper instead of the default helper.
	
	
 
6. Implementation Comments
--------------------------
6.1 In order to help user to identify which tooltip window belongs to which
	canvas element when multiple tooltip windows is opened, Focus Listener for
	the text field in the windows is implemented to highlight the source canvas
	element when user clicks on the description text.

7. Unit Test
------------
7.1 Run manual test [4].
