# Stall stepping in deterministic mode
### xtUML Project Design Note


1. Abstract
-----------
 If a model is running in deterministic mode, when stepping over an interface 
 operation, execution stalls with the stepping buttons disabled.

2. Document References
----------------------
[1] Issues 1, https://github.com/xtuml/doc/issues/82  
[2] ClearQuest DEI dts0100943423 - Stall stepping in deterministic mode  
[3] ClearQuest DEI dts0100942182 - Model execution stepping behavior is not 
	deterministic  

3. Background
-------------
None.

4. Requirements
---------------
None.

5. Analysis
-----------
5.1 The stepping logic needs to wake up the deterministic execution loop so that 
	the remote component can process the message being stepped over. 


6. Design
---------
6.1 Invoke BPDebugTarget.Notify() in both BPStackFrame.StepOver() and 
  BPStackFrame.StepInto() 

7. Design Comments
------------------
7.1 The proposed fix will also resolve one of the cases reported in [3]. 

7.2 When StepOver an interface operation with return value, but the its
  body is missing return statement, it look like the verifier is stalled but
  this is not the case. What is happening is a repeated invocation for the
  interface operation because of the missing return value, this can be noticeable
  by adding non-return statement to the interface operation body (e.g. dummy=1;)
  and add a breakpoint to this statement. When stepOver the interface operation,
  the breakpoint will get hit, stepOver to return to the previous activity body
  (where the interface operation got invoked) and stepOver again, the added
  breakpoint will get hit again (the stepOver button is not disabled in this
  use-case). This bug is reported in [3] and will not get fixed by work
  outlined in the design section.
 

8. Unit Test
------------
8.1 Run Verifier junit tests.  
8.2 Add new test case cover stepping over a wired interface operation/signal 
  and verify that verifier is not stalled.
