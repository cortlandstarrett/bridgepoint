# Inconsistent display and interpretation of list of interface signal parameters through VIEC component
### xtUML Project Design Note

1. Abstract
-----------
    List of executable property  parameters is inconsistently displayed in the 
  BridgePoint tool, namely between the model explorer, properties window and in 
  canvas (graphical representation of the interface). This later leads to 
  inconsistent and erratic interpretation and behavior..

2. Document References
----------------------
[1] Issues 56, https://github.com/xtuml/internal/issues/56

[2] ClearQuest DEI dts0100835691 - Inconsistent display and interpretation of 
	list of interface signal parameters through VIEC component

3. Background
-------------
None.

4. Requirements
---------------
4.1 Mapping between executable property parameters and their values in realized 
  component must not get effected if parameter are re-ordered in UML. 

5. Analysis
-----------
5.1 Using realized component, passing values to list of parameters is working
  properly as long as the user does not re-order the parameters in UML using 
  Move up/Move down CME labels. 
 
5.2 If the user re-orders one or more parameter, and update the realized java 
  classes with the new order, values will not be passed to their proper 
  parameters. This happens because the value/parameter mapping does consider 
  parameter reordering and keep using the original order.
  This behavior is independent on the improper parameter order in the properties
  view. 

5.3 The defect lies in VerifierInvocationHandler.invoke(). The code takes the
  parameters in the order found in the execution database. 
  This is incorrect, it should find the first parameter based on the ordering 
  association R4021 and then traverse R4021 to handle the parameters in the 
  correct order.


6. Design
---------
6.1 Edit VerifierInvocationHandler.invoke() as mentioned in 5.3

7. Design Comments
------------------
None.

8. Unit Test
------------
8.1 Debug verifier tests must pass
8.2 Create a new test that pass a list of values to a list of executable property
  parameters that is reordered before using Move Up/Move Down CME labels.
