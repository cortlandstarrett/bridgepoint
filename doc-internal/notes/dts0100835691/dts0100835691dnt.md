# Reflexive Association have no clear connection between association end and attribute
### xtUML Project Design Note

1. Abstract
-----------
When formalizing reflexive associations, there is no clear connection between 
the formalizing attribute and the association end.

For Reflexive associations with associative classes, formalizing results in two 
attributes with the same name in the association class. There is no possibility 
to connect each attribute to the association end without running the Verifier.

The issue [2] was fixed , but the customer -SAAB- did not like the fix
and asked to reopen the issue.

2. Document References
----------------------

[1] Issues 39, https://github.com/xtuml/internal/issues/39

[2] ClearQuest DEI dts0100835691 - Formalized Reflexive Association have no 
	clear connection between the association end and the formalized attribute.

3. Background
-------------
 This issue was previously resolved, but the customer -SAAB- asked to enhance the 
resolution and to reopen the issue.  

 In the implemented fix, two Textboxes were added to the formalize wizard to 
allow the user to enter two different prefixes for each referential identifier.
 
 This helps the user to differentiate between the created referential 
identifiers, but it was ambiguous which prefix goes to which association ends. 
Therefore the customer requested to reopen the issue.

4. Requirements
---------------
4.1 In a reflexive association, the direction between the formalizing attribute 
    each connection's end shall be clear.


5. Analysis
-----------
5.1 In formalize wizard, the user shall be able to add a prefix to referential 
    identifiers and it shall be clear for the user which association end will be 
    hooked up with each specific entered prefixe.

5.1.1 In the formalize wizard, it shall be required to choose which association end
      each prefix is associated with.

5.1.2 The formalize wizard page shall read as follows : 

5.1.2.1 Suggestion 1:    
Prefix [< entered prefix >] will be associated with identifier [< ID >] of class < key letter > for the [< assocaition text phrase >] side

5.1.2.2 Suggestion 2:  
< key letter >  :  Prefix [< entered prefix > ] for  [ < ID > ] is associated with < Phrase .. >

5.1.3 Suggestion 5.1.2.1  shall be used because if the relation text phrase was empty, 
"for the [ ] side" will be removed without breaking the meaning.

5.1.4 The change made to the formalize shall be cosistent for associative, reflexive, 
      binary associations.

5.1.5 The user can add a prefix for both referential identifiers or only to one of them.

6. Design
---------
6.1 Edit page.inc  archetype file in order to :  
6.1.1 Change the format of Formalize wizard to match 5.1.2.1 for the three types 
      of associations.  
6.1.2 Display the association text phrase ( if it exists )  
6.1.3 Allow the user to enter only one prefix without cause crash.  

7. Design Comments
------------------
None.

8. Unit Test
------------
A new unit test shall be create for this testing.  The existing formalizztion test shall be used as
the starting point for this test.

8.1 Assure the the new prefixes are properly used.
8.1.2 Repeat the flooowing for each type of association: reflexive, binary, associative
    _- Formalize the selected association
    _- Entering a prefix for the referential identifiers 
    _- validate that the prefixes are added to the created identifiers.

8.2 Repeat 8.1 with just 1 prefix

8.3 Repeat 8.1 with no prefixes specified


End
