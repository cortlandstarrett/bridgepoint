# Honor user-defined order in realized bridges
### xtUML Project Implementation Note

1. Abstract
-----------
This note describes the changes required to honor user-defined ordering of
bridge parameters when calling realized bridges during verification.

2. Document References
----------------------
[1] Issues 153, https://github.com/xtuml/doc/issues/153  
[2] CQ Issue, dts0101023147  

3. Background
-------------
Customers have reported a case where verification of a realized bridge operation
results in parameters being passed in an incorrect order.

4. Requirements
---------------
4.1 User-defined ordering of parameters shall be honored when executing realized
    bridge operations.

5. Work Required
----------------
5.1 Honor user-defined ordering during realized bridge operation execution

When gathering the values to pass to a realized bridge operation we iterate over
all parameters that are children of that operation.  This is done using a for
loop and processes the array of children in order of creation.  R55 exists to
allow user-defined ordering of bridge parameters.  The code that is setting the
values to pass to the realized operation does not use R55 to cover ordering.
This code is modified to get the first bridge parameter and process the
parameters in a while loop.  The while loop is exited when there are no
succeeding parameters.

5.2 Support user-defined ordering in the properties tree

BuildPropertySource.arc is modified to make use of the generated sorting classes
found in bp.core.  The property source classes are configured to create an
instance of MetadataSortingManager, then call sort on all child references after
obtaining the list of children.  This sorts the child array.  This will sort the
tree in the exact manner that the model explorer tree is sorted.

6. Implementation Comments
--------------------------

7. Unit Test
------------
_- Create a project with a component with a nested package
_- Add a function to the package
_- In the created function add:
    LOG::LogInfo(message:TEST::concat_string(s1:"Hello, ", s2:"World!"));
_- Add the built-in EEs
_- Create an EE TEST
_- Add a bridge operation concat_string
_- Add a parameter to the operation named s2
_- Add a parameter to the operation named s1
_- Move s1 to be before s2
_- Open the properties view for the bridge operation
_R The children parameters are listed with s1 first
_- Create a java realized version of the EE
_- Add the concat_string() method to the java class
_- Set the body of the method to:
	return s1 + s2;
_- Launch verifier on the component, enabling "Log model execution activity"
_- Execute the function
_R The output text should read:
    "Hello World!"
