#  Provide utility to change Model Compiler after project is created
### xtUML Project Design Note


1. Abstract
-----------
This note describes the design of a tool that allows users to switch the model 
compiler associated with a project.  

2. Document References
----------------------
[1] Issues 177, https://github.com/xtuml/internal/issues/177    
[2] CQ DEI dts0101004964 - Provide utility to change Model Compiler after project is created   
[3] CQ DEI dts0100962274 - Test and document recommended approach for xtUML Editor to Model Compiler flow  
[4] Issues 136 - Stop shipping heritage mc3020 plug-in  

3. Background
-------------
BridgePoint current has the user select which model compiler they want to associate
with a project at project creation time.  xtUML Editor does not give the user any 
choice.  

For the Indus release, we are removing the old MC-3020 build plug-in [4].  Customers
that currently use this builder need an upgrade path to one of the new-style model
compiler plug-ins.  

A tool that allows the user to switch the MC associated with a project will fulfill
the needs presented by both use cases.  
 
4. Requirements
---------------
4.1  BridgePoint shall provide a tool to switch the MC associated with a project.  
4.2  The switcher tool shall be able to add a model compiler to a project created
  with xtUML Editor.  
4.3  The tool shall remove references to the deprecated XMI Export nature and builder.  
4.4  The tool shall allow the user to switch from their current MC selection (old MC-3020
  or new-style) to any other new-style option they are licensed for.  
4.5  The tool shall allow the MC switch to happen regardless of the enabled or 
  disabled state of the current MC or pre-builder.  
4.6  BridgePoint help shall be updated with usage instructions for the tool (to resolve [3]).  
4.7  The tool shall be available from any project navigation view (i.e. Project 
  Explorer and Model Explorer at a minimum).  
4.8  The tool shall be launched via the project context menu under 
  "BridgePoint Utilities > Switch Project Model Compiler".
