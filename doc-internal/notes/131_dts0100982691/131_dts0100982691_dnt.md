# Provide more information in tooltip when user hovers over element for a longer time
### xtUML Project Design Note


1. Abstract
-----------
Customers request to add some enhancement to the current tooltip implementation.
This note describe the required enhancements, and the different implementation 
techniques to address them.  

2. Document References
----------------------

3. Background
-------------
See [3].  

4. Requirements
---------------
4.1 The tooltip windows shall only close when mouse pointer moves outside 
canvas element area and tooltip window.  

4.2 The tooltip shall have minimum and maximum size regardless of the element
description text size.  

4.3 The tooltip window shall contain active scroll bars when needed.  

4.4 The tooltip window shall be able to get focus when the mouse pointer moves 
 into it and clicked.  

4.5 (Optional) The tooltip window shall be resizable.  

4.6 (Optional) The tooltip window shall store the new size if user resized it.  

4.7 (Optional) The tooltip shall allow use to click on links (url , file link)
			in the description text.  
			
4.8 (Optional) The tooltip window can contain an image if the user set the image
	path in description text.  

5. Analysis
-----------
This section is only required if there is no preceding analysis note. If present
it sets out a brief analysis of the problem to be resolved by this design note.

* Item 1
* Item 2
* Item 3

6. Design
---------
In this section, describe in detail each step of the Work Required section of
the analysis, how the task will be accomplished, what technologies will
be used, algorithms, etc.

6.1 Some design point, with a code example
```java
    public void clearDatabase(IProgressMonitor pm) 
    {
        // clear the corresponding graphics-root's database
        OoaofgraphicsUtil.clearGraphicsDatabase(rootId, pm);

        Ooaofooa.getDefaultInstance().fireModelElementUnloaded(this);
    }
```

7. Design Comments
------------------
If research carried out during this phase shows that a requirement stated in the
analysis note is infeasible or needs some modification, enumerate those changes
here. If there was no preceding analysis note, then this section documents any
deviations from the design as presented at the design review.

8. Unit Test
------------
Outline all the unit tests that need to pass and describe the method that you
will use to design and perform the tests.

End
