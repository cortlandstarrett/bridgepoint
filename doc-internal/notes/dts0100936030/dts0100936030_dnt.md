Fix parameter handling for unique_ids in VIEC
### xtUML Project Design Note


1. Abstract
-----------
Verifier cannot export the values of parameters of type 'unique_id'. Instead
it throws a java runtime error. This note discusses the options for fixing
this.

2. Document References
----------------------
[1] dts0100936030 - Verifier execution breaks when VIEC synchronous operation
    with parameter of unique_id type is invoked.
[2] GH issue TBD
[3] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier

3. Background
-------------
There are two types of unique ids, those internal to Verifier and externally
created ones. Internally, each running component instance allocates unique
ids as integers starting at 1 and incrementing for each unique id allocated.
Externally, unique_ids are assumed by Verifier to be based on an
implementation of the UUID (Universally Unique IDentifier) standard[3]. This
problem is caused by the impedance mismatch between Verifier's internal
implementation and the UUID standard. This impedance mismatch is a direct
result of the two implementations meeting different requirements. Since
instance populations in Verifier are partitioned by executing components, a
unique identifier need only be unique for the component instance that created
it. The UUID standard however meets a requirement much greater in scope,
that is, it is required to produce identifiers which are unique in a global,
fully asynchronous system. The only possible way to meet this is to create
very large pseudo-random numbers which have an astronomically low probability
of duplication. This fix for this issue must find a robust way of bridging
this impedance gap.

4. Requirements
---------------
4.1 Verifier must handle passing unique id's as parameter values in both
    directions.
4.2 A unique_id passed out must identify any internal element associated with
    it when it is passeed back in.
4.3 Unique ID's created outside of Verifier and passed in must be passed out
    unmodified.

5. Analysis
-----------
Looking at the code, Unique Id's must not have been part of the original data
set specified as supported. The code which marshals data values into and out
of Verifier has almost no explicit support for them.

This is the exception reported in the issue:

Exception in thread "Verifier (RealizedTestReportGenerator)"
java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Invalid UUID string: 1
        at java.util.UUID.fromString(Unknown Source)
        at com.mentor.nucleus.bp.debug.java.access.VerifierInvocationHandler.
                  convertToRawJavaType(VerifierInvocationHandler.java:371)

This is thrown when an internal value of unique_id is passed out from Verifier.
The passed in value of '1' does not conform to the UUID statndard as
implemented for Java so the exception is to be expected.

5.1 Fixes considered
One obvious way of fixing the headline issue is just taking the passed simple
unique_id integer allocated and forming it into the UUID format such that the
exception is not thrown. However, there are a couple issues with this approach
that need to be considered:

5.1.1 UUID format
When we moved to global data types, all global types had to have the same UUID
value in all workspaces. We did this by allocating the integer value into the
lower portion of the UUID and stamped the upper group with a semi human
readable digit sequence that would make it stand out as a fixed UUID value. We
might consider the same strategy here, but choose a different digit sequence.

5.1.2 ID Uniqueness
Section 3 called out the impedance mismatch between Verifier uniqueness and
UUID uniqueness. This is a bigger problem than it looks. Verifier's unique_id
implementation cannot hold a complete UUID internally so a major Verifier re-
write would be required. Further, such a rewrite which would likely have to
wait until after removing dependency on the generator parser. There
is another reason why we might not want to simply use UUID's internally.
Currently Verifier displays the identifier of instances in the Session
Explorer and Variables views. Showing a UUID here is impractical, not to
mention illegible. This might be addressed by displaying a trucated portion of
the UUID, but all in all, using UUID's internally does not look to be an
attractive proposal. The conclusion is that we must produce some kind of
mapping between internal and external unique id's. This poses another problem;
the simple mapping proposed in 5.1.1 does not remotely meet the global UUID
standard in that such synthesized UUID's would not be unique between components
or workspaces.

5.1.2.1 Inter-component uniqueness
We could make unique_ids unique for their creating component by additionally
inserting the component instance id into the exported UUID. However this raises
the question of what to do if a UUID created in one component is passed into
another and used for locating an instance. The simplest response would be to
simply not find a match, but it might be desirable to report an error.

5.1.2.2 Inter-workspace uniqueness
This is only an issue if runtime data is shared between models running on
different machines and/or workspaces. Although Verifier does not support this
at present, it has been discussed as a future roadmap item. However, after this
fix, customers will be able to get unique_id values out into java and beyond,
so this possiblity must be considered now, even if we decide to specify that
inter-machine/workspace uniqueness will not be supported.

5.1.2.3 Proposal
Simple mapping, plus an origin stamp, plus component id stamp gives reasonable
uniqueness assurance for now. We should add a statement to the release notes
to manage customer expectation in the wider scope.

5.2 Handle incoming and outgoing unique ids
There is no point in addressing the headline issue without also addressing
incoming UUID values cleanly, more field issues are bound to follow. Out-
going ids are fully discussed in 5.1 above. Incoming id's pose another new
challenge. Given that we adopt the outgoing mappings proposed in 5.1, what
does Verifier do with incoming UUID's that were created externally? As
already observed, we cannot pass them around the running model, and we cannot
usefully display them. We could either construct a map, or add a string
attribute to store the UUID as it is passed around the Verifier runtime.

5.2.1 UUID map
The proposal here is that we hold a map of incoming UUID's which do not match
the signature proposed in 5.1.1. Then, a new internal unique_id value is
allocated and actually used within Verifier. The incoming UUID is placed in the
Map using the allocated unique_id as a key. When a unique id is output, the
map is consulted. If the key produces a match, the original UUID is pulled from
the Map and output. If it is not found in the map, the UUID synthesis policy
proposed in 5.1 is followed. 

5.2.2 String attribute
This alternative is that an incoming UUID is converted to a unique_id value as
before, but rather than creating a map, the UUID is stored in anew string
attibute of Runtime value. On output, this string is used to recreate the UUID
if it contains a valid value.

5.2.3 Conclusion
It is more diffiult to make a choice here, the Map solution is the simpler of
the two, but it would be difficult to show the actual UUID value in the UI during
debugging. The second proposal adds a lot of data to be shifted around during
Verifier runtime, and even if the UUID is present, it is not clear that the
current UI design would make it easy to show the actual UUID value even if it was
easily accessible. On balance, the proposal in 5.2.1 is selected for its
simplicity.
