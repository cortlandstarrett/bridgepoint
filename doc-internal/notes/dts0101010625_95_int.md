# Missing Images in Help Docs
### xtUML Project Implementation Note


1. Abstract
-----------
Some of the images in the BridgePoint help documents are not displaying when in 
the BridgePoint Help browser.

2. Document References
----------------------
[1] Issues 95, https://github.com/xtuml/internal/issues/95  
[2] CQ DEI dts0101010625

3. Background
-------------
Nothing actually "broke" in our build.  What we have seen is that on some 
systems eclipse is choking when rendering the MS Word output HTML.  Because it 
works on some systems and not on others (even amongst the same OS, say Win 7) 
it appears to be related to some underlying DLL on the system.   
   
4. Requirements
---------------
4.1  Images shall be displayed in the eclipse Help browser.

5. Work Required
----------------
5.1  The fix is to save the HTML from MS Word as "Web Page, Filtered" so it uses
really plain HTML and leaves out some of the fancy (MS specific) HTML tags MS Word uses.

6. Implementation Comments
--------------------------
None.

7. Unit Test
------------
7.1  Open the pages in the Help, verify images are displayed.

8. Code Changes
---------------
Branch name: 95_help_doc_images


End
