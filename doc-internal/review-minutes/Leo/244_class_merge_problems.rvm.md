<pre>

-- Num Type  Who  Section  Comment
x- 01  min   SKB  [2]      Wrong CQ number
x- 02  min   bob  4        formatting problem
x- 03  min   trl  7.2      This is only when it is in a compare situation (when it is a compare root)
x- 04  min   bob  7.4      "not elements " -> "not all elements "
x- 05  min   bob  7.5      Make sure there is documentation for this debug flag.  Perhaps we should add
                           a preference (or something like that) to turn this debug flag on (that could make it 
						   self-documenting).
x- 06  min   tlr  8.1      The first stepsshould say that it is a class file referring to another class (it
                            is a RGO)
X- 07  min   skb  8.3      Add an expected result after the "undo" step
x- 08  min   bob  8.4      This should call out that this has to start with 2 states and a transition between the 2 states.
