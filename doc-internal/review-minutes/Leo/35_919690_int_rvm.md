-- Num Type  Who  Section  Comment

Implementation note review:
_-  01  min  TL  References  [2] points at Issues 2 and should be 35
 

Code review:
_- 01  min  KB    cherry pick the JRE change to use same JRE as workspace
_- 02  min  KB    open an issue to add finer granularity to java pre-build output
_- 03  min  KB    there is a conflict on bp.als/generate.xml.  We think this is due to the change to the clean_sql target.  Back out this change.
_- 04  min  KB    In several plug-ins (bp.core, ui.canvas, etc), we want to add the gen/ folder and add a .gitignore that ignores the code_generation folder
_- 05  min  KB    In bp.core/.project, try removing the MCJavaNature and see if it still works.  Maybe remove from bp.internal.tools as well
_- 06  min  KB    Raise an issue against the model compiler pre-builder infrastructure to make it robust in the face of missing settings in build_settings.properties


Additional comments from read-through review (not yet full observations):
1. In arch_utils.inc at line 694, why is the else clause removed?
2. Same file at line 719, why are the text phrases switched?
3. build.xml, we now call xtumlmc_cleanse_for_BP shouldn't the file be cleansed by the client passing in the source sql data?
4. Isn't ooa_schema.sql generated now?
5. schema_gen.arc, for my understanding, did generator add the Order attribute for ordered elements?  If not why is it now added?  Also where does this list come from?  For instance why is R_REL getting the  Order addition?
6. value.inc same comment as 1, V_PEX removal.

No major observations, a re-review is not required.
