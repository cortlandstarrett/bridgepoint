-- Num Type  Who  Section  Comment
x- 01  min   CM   8        Make sure we test all relationship types, not just reflexives.  See if we are covered or need to add more testing.
       TL: Adequate testing is already in place, the observation was to make sure we test the instance populations.  These are tested
           in the verifier audit tests.
x- 02  min   TL   8        For all the OAL in the test cases, the text phrase should be 'start', not 'end'

No major observations, a re-review is not required.
