-- Num Type  Who  Section  Comment
_- 01  min   TRL  general      Consider allowing "none" as an option in the utility.  If it is not 
                               easy raise an issue to allow the 
                               user to select "none" otherwise do it.
_- 02  min   SKB  general      Add a note to release notes that tells user they must use this utility if using mc3020
_- 03  min   TRL  general      Raise an issue to introduce a MC-Java plugin (like our other MC plugins).  We
                               could potentially use this in our builds.
_- 04  min   TRL  general      Raise issue to remove the XMI plugin, or fix it.
_- 05  min   TRL  4.7.1      change this: Set Model Compiler
_- 06  min   SBK  6.4      Change to be consistent with the name change specified for 4.7.1
_- 07  min   bob  8        include  > included 
_- 08  min   all  8.1      we decided to leave old files in the .externalToolBuilders folder.  Add this info to the note
_- 09  min   SKB  8      add test that turns off MC-licensing and make sure that, that one doesn't show
_- 10  min   SKB  8      add test to assure that the "current" MC does not show up in the list:
                         --perhaps disable the option if there are no other choices, or maybe allow the current MC
						   to still be listed
						 --"none" may be an option
						 --consider the xtuml editor in the choice

No major observations, a re-review is not required.
