-- Num Type  Who  Section  Comment
_- 01  min   bob  3      The background only focuses on a specific problem, merge related, that was behind this.
                           However, this tool has been talked about a very long time.  While not all aspects of an integrity tool are addressed here, this does provide the foundation for those other things,
						   and so those things should be called out and referenced in the background.
_- 02  min   bob  5.1      note that these were added under a new subsystem
_- 03  min   bob  4        Note: Any model integrity issues as defined in the google doc.  
                           Reference the documents
_- 04  maj   bob  5.1.2   Why not implement this with encapsulation?

			I prefer the pattern where the integrity check in encapsulated into the Integrity Manager (IM) class .  You then end up with:
			IM.checkAssociation
			IM.checkInterfaceOperation
			IM.checkPort
			...
			(thus all this functionality is encapsualted into the Integrity Manager instead of being sread across the ooaofooa)_- 05  min   xxx  xxx      xxx
			
			There could be an interface and each intergity check would then define a class that implements that interface.  This could be added to the editor and users could extend it!
			
_- 05  min   bob  5.1.2      Make these self-documenting.
			Example: For every type of integrity check there should be an associated description that is returned
			by a call.   This could be controlled usng an enum that defines all the integrity checks.
			There can be 1 operation, getDescrition(enum IntegrityCheckType) that returns the description for each integrity check.

_- 06  maj   keith  5.1.2   Describe why we check the signature and not just the name.  Isn't this language dependant?
_- 07  min   bob  5.2.1      danling -> dangling
                             There is also a formating issue here:
 							 Element Name: param Element Path: ModelIntegrityTests::Operation Parameter Tests::Class::Operation::param
_- 08  min   keith  5.2.2      note that it does support select/copy
_- 09  min   keith  5.4       Move 5.4 to section 6
_- 10  min   bob  7      There should be a test for every <blah>.checkIntegrity() implemented.  There is, just 
                           describe it.
_- 11  min   Travis  5.2.1   For dnagling referneces the name is coming in as the path, and it should just the the name.

Major observations were recorded, a re-review is required.
