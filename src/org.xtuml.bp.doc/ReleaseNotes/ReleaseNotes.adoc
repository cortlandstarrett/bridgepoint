create desktop shortcuts to start BridgePoint should set the shortcut to start `<install dir>/bridgepoint`.

preferences at `xtUML > Action Language > Default Action Language Dialect`. The default is set to OAL.       
  
=== Interoperability with Previous Releases
BridgePoint 6.18 is compatible with workspaces and projects created with prior versions back to
