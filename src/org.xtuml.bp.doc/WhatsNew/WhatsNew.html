<h3 id="_deployments">Deployments</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A new model element type named "Deployment" is introduced for system modeling. It
uses elements called "Terminators" and "Terminator Services" to specify connections
between components.  Deployments do not have graphics, but they are first-class
xtUML elements shown in Model Explorer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Deployments are an alternative, not a replacement, for the long-standing xtUML
approach of wiring together components graphically with provided and required
interfaces.  This alternative is primarily targeted at MASL modelers and provides
a more natural method of defining system level connections that are familiar with
ASL methodology.</p>

<div class="title">Figure 1. GPS Watch Deployment</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The GPS Watch - MASL example project is modified to use deployments and is an
excellent reference to see the functionality in action.  The MASL Modeling and
Conversion Guide documentation in BridgePoint is updated with instructions for
modeling with Deployments.  New context menus are added to populate Deployments
with terminator details either from interface files or from existing components.</p>

<h3 id="_masl_output">MASL Output</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Various features and fixes are made to the MASL export flow. Highlights
are listed here.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><code>xtuml2masl</code> is enhanced to work completely without eclipse.  This enhancement
is particularly useful when integrating <code>xtuml2masl</code> into a command line based
tool chain.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The "Export MASL &#8230;&#8203;" context menus are deprecated.  MASL export is
now accomplished as part of the build process. Projects are configured to use
MASL Exporter as part of the model compiler selection. See "Build Tooling"
below for important information about configuring existing projects to use
this builder.</p>

<div class="title">Figure 3. MASL Exporter Builder</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Project preferences are added to control the functionality of MASL Exporter.
These preferences address feature requests to control whether MASL output
is formatted or not and to control the destination folder for the exported
files.</p>

<h3 id="_marking_listener">Marking Listener</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>BridgePoint supports two methods of marking.  This release enhances the functionality
of the marking method typically used by MASL models that relies on <code>application.mark</code>
and <code>features.mark</code> files.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The tool now performs automatic updates to element markings stored in <code>application.mark</code>
as elements are renamed, moved, or change types or parameters. These automatic
updates are performed by a listener that runs in the background and responds to
model changes.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_build_tooling">Build Tooling</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> A major upgrade of the BridgePoint model compilers is included
in this version of the tool.  Projects using model compilers created before
this version must be upgraded.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code>Use the following procedure to update existing models. It is recommended
that projects that are not in revision control be backed up before an upgrade
is attempted.

1. Right click on the project and select "Properties"

2. In the "Builders" section, select "Missing builder (org.xtuml.bp.mc.*.export_builder)" and click "Remove"

3. In the "Builders" section, select "Missing Compiler" and click "Remove"

4. Click "Apply and Close"

5. Right click on the project and select "BridgePoint Utilities &gt; Set Model Compilers"

6. Follow the wizard to enable your desired model compiler(s)</code></pre>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Full details of the change, including new preference settings, and new project
wizard changes are detailed <a href="https://github.com/xtuml/bridgepoint/blob/master/doc-bridgepoint/notes/11491_mcs/11491_mcs_int.adoc">in this note</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Questions about model upgrade can be directed to the
<a href="https://hangouts.google.com/group/vMohZ9oW08xR7wSd2">xtUML Community Chat</a>
or to the <a href="https://xtuml.org/community/forum/xtuml-forum/">xtUML.org forums</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The "Build project" feature is extended with additional enhancements for
consistent MASL export and clean build on Windows.</p>

<h3 id="_state_event_matrix_fixes">State Event Matrix Fixes</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Fixes are applied to the state event matrix table:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>A redraw issue is fixed on Linux that caused rows to display incorrect
information as the mouse was moved around.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Additionally, a fix is applied that addresses an exception thrown in
places where creation events are shown.</p>
