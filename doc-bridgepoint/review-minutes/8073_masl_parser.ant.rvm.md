x- 01  min   cds  2.3      link broken
x- 02  min   bob  3        capture the whiteboard picture, reference the new diagram here in the flow description
x- 03  min   cds  general  change the name "Tower" to "user" throughout the document
x- 04  min   bob  4.3      add a reference to the model of MASL
x- 05  min   cds  5        capture our open question "Can the semantic assistance in the MASL editor be 
  implemented simply in the parse tree, or does it require the abstract syntax tree?"
x- 06  min   cds  5        Discussion lead to the decision that we will go forward now with ANTLR and set xText aside
  for phase 1 and only bring in xtext when we implement the fully-functional (non-notepad style) MASL 
  editor.

Major observations were recorded, a re-review is required
