-- Num Type  Who  Section  Comment
_- 01  min   CDS  4.1      I am not sure refactoring would need “triggering” when using a cross-reference approach.
_- 02  min   CDS  5.1      port is missing
_- 03  min   bob  5.1      please call out where this list came from
_- 04  min   xxx  3        This background is not quite right.  The work WAS promoted [2][3], and functionality was removed, but not all the changes [4]. Please describe this, and also describe why it was removed.
_- 05  min   bob  2[7]     Please write the full name and acronym here so people see what it means 1 time before using it in the document.
_- 05  min   bob  7        you should not have to re-type the list here, you should jsut be able to refer to the list created earlier in the document.  This assures the information is in only 1 place.
_- 05  min   bob  6.1      Note tha this is really not just a matter of merging anymore. If you go look and see you will find the amount of chaneg is such that it really will need to be redone, merge will not be useful.

_- 01  min   CDS  xxx      Should activities be rendered in the editor buffer (like rtf, html, etc)?
_- 02  min   CDS  xxx      Should we take the approach of keeping the untagged and tagged buffers separately?
_- 03  min   CDS  xxx      What is the connection of references with editor assistance (naming)?
_- 04  min   CDS  xxx      if I am typing along and simply type my attribute/keyletters/etc, and it does not exist in the model, what kind of tag is there?
_- 05  min   xxx  xxx      xxx
