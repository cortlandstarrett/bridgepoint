-- Num Type  Who  Section  Comment
_- 01  min   xxx  4.1      I am not sure refactoring would need “triggering” when using a cross-reference approach.
_- 02  min   xxx  5.1      port is missing
_- 03  min   xxx  xxx      xxx
_- 04  min   xxx  xxx      xxx
_- 05  min   xxx  xxx      xxx

_- 01  min   xxx  xxx      Should activities be rendered in the editor buffer (like rtf, html, etc)?
_- 02  min   xxx  xxx      Should we take the approach of keeping the untagged and tagged buffers separately?
_- 03  min   xxx  xxx      What is the connection of references with editor assistance (naming)?
_- 04  min   xxx  xxx      if I am typing along and simply type my attribute/keyletters/etc, and it does not exist in the model, what kind of tag is there?
_- 05  min   xxx  xxx      xxx
