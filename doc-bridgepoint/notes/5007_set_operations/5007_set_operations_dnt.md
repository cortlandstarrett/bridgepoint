# Operators `+`, `-`, `and` and `or` of instance handle sets are missing in OAL.
### xtUML Project Design Note

### 1. Abstract

Set operators for instance sets are supported in RSL but not in OAL. This issue
is raised to analyze and implement support in OAL. Verifier and model compiler
support will also be considered.

### 3. Background

The reader should review the background section of [[2.2]](#2.2).

In addition to the three set operations covered in the background section of
[[2.2]](#2.2), the reader should be familiar with the following:

* The **symmetric difference** (disjunctive union/disunion) of sets A and B (`A
  ^ B`) is the set of all elements that are in set A or in set B but _not_ both.
  Symmetric difference is also associative, meaning `A ^ B == B ^ A`.

### 4. Requirements

The following requirements are sourced from the Sortie-1 SRS [[2.3]](#2.3).
They are worded slightly differently than the requirements in the analysis note
[[2.2]](#2.2) because they were reformatted when the Sortie-1 SRS was produced.

4.1 OAL shall support instance set union (addition) expressions.  
4.2 OAL shall support instance set intersection expressions.  
4.3 OAL shall support instance set subtraction expressions.  
4.4 Both instance set types and instance reference types shall be supported for
either operand.  
4.4.1 An operand of instance reference type shall logically be considered an
instance set containing exactly one instance.  
4.5 Operators `+` and `|` shall be supported for union expressions.  
4.6 Operator `&` shall be supported for intersection expressions.  
4.7 Operator `-` shall be supported for subtraction expressions.  
4.8 Verifier shall support the set operations.  

The following requirements are not part of the Sortie-1 deliverable requirements
however they shall be satisfied as part of this work.

4.9 OAL shall support instance set symmetric difference (disunion) expressions.  
4.10 Operator `^` shall be supported for symmetric difference expressions.  
4.11 MC-3020 shall support the set operations.  

### 5. Analysis

5.a Operator precedence

Part of this feature that was not explored in depth in the analysis note is
operator precedence. The operators that are introduced must fit into the
hierarchy of existing operators and have well established rules of precedence
among themselves. Several outside sources were analyzed to make a decision that
fits in with existing tools.

5.a.1 RSL (old generator)

The old RSL generator did not have explicit precedence for binary
operations but required parentheses to explicitly specify order of operations.
This is the way the `rsl2oal` converter utility that is used by MC-3020 works.

5.a.2 `pyrsl`

Version 1.0.0 of `pyrsl` does have inherent precedence of binary operators,
however it wasn't explicitly stated in the docs. Not much further investigation
into `pyrsl` was done to discover the exact ordering. The original designer
stated that little attention was paid to this part of the interpreter design.

5.a.3 Python

Operator precedence in Python was analyzed since set operations are supported
natively (see [[2.4]](#2.4)). The table in the Python docs shows that the `|`
and `&` operators (which are used for union and intersection) are lower
precedence than even addition. The table only cites bitwise operations, however
so the actual precedence for the set operations is not clear, however it is
assumed to be the same as the bitwise operations since they use the same
operators.

5.a.4 MASL

The most definitive data we have is from MASL. One of the original designers of
the MASL language provided this operator precedence table. The rows are listed
in order from highest precedence (most binding) to lowest precedence (least
binding).

| Expression/operation type        | Operators                                                        |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Primary                          | (...), literal, name, domain::name                               |
| Extended (postfix, create, find) | a.b, a~>b, a[…], a’b, a(...), find a where (...), create a (...) |
| Navigate                         | a->Rx                                                            |
| Link                             | link a Rx b                                                      |
| Unary                            | +a -a, not a, abs a                                              |
| Multiplicative                   | \*, /, mod, pow, rem, intersection, disunion                     |
| Additive                         | +, -, & (concatenate), union, not_in                             |
| Relational                       | <, >, <=, >=                                                     |
| Equality                         | =, /= (not equal to... Ada heritage!)                            |
| Logical And                      | and                                                              |
| Logical XOR                      | xor                                                              |
| Logical Or                       | or                                                               |
| Range                            | a .. b                                                           |

MASL supports all three of the originally analyzed set operations, however, in
MASL, set subtraction is done by the operator `not_in` (e.g. `A not_in B`
returns a set containing all the elements which are in `A` but not `B`). MASL
also supports "disunion" which is the symmetric difference (or disjunctive
union).

5.a.5 Conclusion

The crispness and precision of the MASL specification in this area is very
valuable. Additionally, the fact that union and difference are additive while
disunion and intersection are multiplicative is consistent with gut feel that
`&` should bind closer than `|`. Support for OAL set operations shall follow the
lead of MASL in precedence rules. Additionally, because MASL supports disunion,
OAL shall support it as part of this work since it will take little extra effort
to achieve.

5.b MC-3020

Some work has already been done to add set addition to MC-3020 [[2.5]](#2.5).
There were problems with the original implementation. The input sets were
modified by the addition operation. Also, the routine assumed that the two sets
were disjoint (no elements existed in both sets). OAL parser limitations
prevented the feature from being very useful.

The work in this area was merged into master [[2.6]](#2.6). This changeset will
be used to set up the framework for the changes to fully implement the set
operations in MC-3020, however, little of the actual implementation will be
reused.

### 6. Design

6.1 Implementation flow

6.1.1 Modify parser to allow syntax of set operations and to correctly parse
them into `V_` instances.  
6.1.2 Build BridgePoint.  
6.1.3 Modify MC-Java to support set operations.  
6.1.4 Use new BridgePoint to implement set operations in Verifier (use the set
operations to implement set operations).  
6.1.4 Build BridgePoint again.  
6.1.5 Use set operations in Verifier.
