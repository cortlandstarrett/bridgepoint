|===

There are three types of association:  simple, ternary and super/subtype.
These are represented in the meta-model as subtypes of R_REL as R_SIMP,
R_ASSOC and R_SUPSUB.

The association editor can create new associations or edit existing
associations.  The dialogue needs to pre-populated correctly in both
cases.

Associations can be between different classes or the same class (reflexive).

Formalization of associations can involve various combinations of identifiers.
0, 1 or more than 1 identifier must be dealt with.  Also, the case of at
least one identifier in each participating class is interesting.

* Configure BridgePoint to require role phrases and formalization.

=== 3.1 Simple Associations

  'part<N>' to 'form<N>'.

. *See* clickable conditionality and multiplicity buttons which toggle.
. Set role phrases with various legal alphanumeric strings.
